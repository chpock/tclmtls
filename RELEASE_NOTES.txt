Release version 1.1.0

Notable changes:

1. Fixed the build process to produce a static version of the package.

2. Added support for Tcl 9

3. Fixed handling of connections with untrusted certificates and disabled
certificate validation when using TLS1.3 protocol.

4. Improved compatibility with tcltls. The ::tls::* aliases for ::mtls::*
procedures are created automatically when the package is loaded, if
the ::tls namespace does not exist at the time of loading. This allows
existing code that is designed to work with tcltls to be used without
modification. Also added some expected fields to the result of
the mtls::status command.
